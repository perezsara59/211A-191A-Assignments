# 191A-GroupProject


## What social problem is being addressed?

  * The effects/presence of Income Inequality among UCLA students. 

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?

  * Low-income UCLA students; by making income differences among students more transparent, the student body as a whole will hopefully be more likely to favor increasing aid to students in need. 
  
## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

  * Privacy of Respondents
  * Getting enough respondents from different economic backgrounds
  * Wording the questions so financially insecure students don't feel shamed
  * Contextualizing the responses within a map
  
## What technology was used for the project?
 
  * Javascript
  * Google Forms
  * Google Sheets
  * Leaflet

## How can others use our mapplication in the future?

  * Students can continue to share their experiences/needs
  * On campus organizations that offer assistance can see what students need
  * Institutions like UCLA can learn about how they can meet students needs better
  
 We're planning to reach out Good Clothes, Good People at UCLA (an on-campus org that provides essentials to students in need) for data about student needs. https://goodclothesgoodpeople.org/
