                <div style="text-indent: 20px; font-family: Open Sans;"> In spring quarter 2021, USAC held an election which included a referendum known as the Bruin Emergency Relief Fund. 
            BERF aimed to “increase undergraduate student fees by $2 per quarter to create an emergency fund for natural disasters, 
            medical costs, legal costs, housing and food insecurity.” This referendum failed to pass. While there were many reasons for this result, it seems that one 
            contributing factor was the lack of awareness that many Bruins have about the financial situation and struggles of their
            low-income peers. Students are often left to suffer the burdens of financial insecurity alone with little to no support from their peers 
            or UCLA as an institution. Feeling left out or being excluded solely because of one's financial situation should not be an 
            additional barrier that students face at a public institution like UCLA, which recently completed a more than <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/centennial-campaign-for-ucla-closing-success">$5 billion</a> 
            fundraising push. On top of the issues already facing low-income students, the COVID-19 pandemic worsened issues for many students, 
            especially financial issues. Remote learning requires access to resources the university had available on campus, but 
            were now unavailable due to relocation. </div>
            <br>
                <div style="text-indent:20px;font-family: Open Sans;">We're trying to tackle the issue of low awareness by allowing Bruins to share how they struggled during the pandemic, 
                and what UCLA could have better done to meet their needs. We've mapped out their responses, and also included relevant information
                such as if they recieve financial aid, if they work to pay for school, and if they're financially independent. We also included several
                open-response questions to allow students to truly express their needs and how UCLA can do better. </div>
